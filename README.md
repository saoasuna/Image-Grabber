Assignment Tracker is an Android application that helps you stay on top of your work. Assignments are displayed using a RecyclerView and stored inside an SQLLiteDatabase. An AVL tree implementation offers quick sorting and allows checks for deadline conflicts. Users are able to share assignment files with one another over Wi-fi through Googleâ€™s Cloud Messaging API and Java Servlets. Notifications are pushed by the app whenever deadlines are approaching or another user is trying to share a file.
